# CloudCanvas Overview

CloudCanvas is a versatile application designed to empower various products within your organization to log their information, create metrics, and utilize them effectively. The primary goal of this portal is to reduce dependency on costly third-party services like Datadog, offering a cost-effective alternative for logging and monitoring needs.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Logging:** Provides a centralized platform for logging information, errors, and metrics generated by different products. This ensures all relevant data is easily accessible and well-organized.
- **Customizable Metrics:** Enables products to define and create their own metrics tailored to their specific requirements. This flexibility allows for better tracking and monitoring of product performance.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Offers a cost-effective solution compared to third-party services like Datadog. By utilizing in-house logging and metrics capabilities, products can significantly reduce operational costs.
- **Encourages Adoption:** The portal promotes the use of APIs that are not cost-prohibitive, making it accessible and encouraging adoption among product teams. This fosters a culture of self-sufficiency and cost-consciousness.
- **Complementary to Datadog:** It's important to note that the portal is not meant to replace Datadog entirely but rather to complement it. It provides an additional space for products to host their logs and metrics, saving costs without sacrificing functionality.

## Getting Started

To start using this Portal, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:** Clone the repository to your local environment and install Python, pip, and Flask.
2. **Configuration:** Please change the code from `app.run(host="0.0.0.0")` to `app.run()` in `web.py` file as that is the landing page for all the APIs. Start creating the APIs with you want for your products and use them.

## Technologies Used

This Portal leverages the following technologies:

- **Python Flask:** The backend of the application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** The frontend of the application is developed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior and interaction.
- **JSON Text Files:** For storing log data and metrics, the application utilizes JSON text files.
- **AI/ML:** For predicting the CPU usage of different customer/servers

## Advantages of AIML usage in the app

- **Resource Optimization:** By predicting CPU usage, admins can proactively allocate resources such as CPU capacity to meet expected demands. This helps in avoiding performance bottlenecks and ensures smooth operation of systems.

- **Capacity Planning:** Predictive CPU usage can aid in capacity planning by providing insights into future resource requirements. Organizations can use these predictions to scale their infrastructure according to expected demand, thereby optimizing resource utilization and cost-effectiveness.

- **Performance Monitoring:** By comparing actual CPU usage with predicted values, admins can monitor system performance in real-time. Deviations between actual and predicted values can indicate potential issues such as software inefficiencies or hardware failures, enabling timely troubleshooting and maintenance.

- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Predictive CPU usage can be used to ensure compliance with SLAs by anticipating resource needs and maintaining service levels. Organizations can use these predictions to guarantee performance targets and meet customer expectations.

- **Cost Optimization:** By accurately predicting CPU usage, organizations can optimize cloud resource provisioning and reduce unnecessary costs associated with over-provisioning. This helps in maximizing cost-efficiency and minimizing operational expenses.

Overall, predictive CPU usage provides valuable insights into system behavior, enabling organizations to make informed decisions, improve operational efficiency, and deliver better user experiences.

## Infrastructure

The Portal is hosted on Amazon Web Services and utilizes a highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective infrastructure setup.
Infrastructure

The Portal is hosted on Amazon Web Services and utilizes a highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective infrastructure setup. The following AWS services are used for different layers of the application:

- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** The application layer is hosted on EC2 instances, providing scalable compute capacity to handle incoming requests from users.

- **EFS (Elastic File System):** EFS is used for the data layer, providing scalable and highly available file storage for storing log data and metrics.

- **ASG (Auto Scaling Group) and NLB (Network Load Balancer):** Auto Scaling Groups and Network Load Balancers are used for network scalability and load balancing. ASG automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic patterns, while NLB efficiently distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.

- **Route 53:** Route 53 is used for domain management, enabling users to access theportal through a custom domain name. Additionally, ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) is used to manage SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication between clients and the application.

This infrastructure setup ensures that the portal is resilient to failures, can handle varying levels of traffic, and remains cost-effective by scaling resources based on demand.


## Contributing

The Portal is initiated by Mainak Chakrabarty and Niel, who conceived the idea during a discussion. Mainak Chakrabarty started the creation and design of the application based on this idea. The project welcomes contributions from individuals who are passionate about improving logging and monitoring capabilities for various products within the organization.
